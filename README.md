# Toy Language in Prolog and OCaml

Welcome to the Toy Language repository! This project implements a simple toy language using Prolog and OCaml. The goal is to provide a basic understanding of language design and interpretation in the context of Prolog and Ocaml.

## Features
- **Minimalistic Language:** The toy language is deliberately kept simple to illustrate the basics of language design and interpretation.

- **Prolog Implementation:** The language interpreter is implemented in Prolog, showcasing how Prolog can be used for tasks beyond traditional logic programming.

- **OCaml Implementation:** The language interpreter implemented in OCaml has a few more functionalities as parallel, sequential, and local definitions.
